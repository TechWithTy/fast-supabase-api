# Migrating Caching Tests from Django to FastAPI

## Context: Fixing Tests During Migration

When migrating caching logic and examples from Django/DRF to FastAPI, we encountered several key differences in how tests must be structured and executed:

### 1. Test Framework
- **Django:** Used Django's built-in test runner and test client, with test cases inheriting from `django.test.TestCase`.
- **FastAPI:** Switched to pytest (with `pytest-asyncio` for async tests) and FastAPI's `TestClient` or `AsyncClient` (from `httpx`).

### 2. Mocking and Dependency Injection
- **Django:** Relied on Django's ORM and request/response objects. Test setup/teardown was tightly coupled to Django's database and cache backends.
- **FastAPI:** Used dependency overrides to inject mock users, cache, and other dependencies. This decouples tests from any specific database or cache implementation, making tests faster and more isolated.

### 3. Caching
- **Django:** Used `django.core.cache` and decorators like `@cache_page`. Tests often cleared the cache using `cache.clear()` in setup/teardown.
- **FastAPI:** Used custom cache utilities (e.g., `get_or_set_cache`, `invalidate_cache`). Tests clear or mock the cache layer directly, and async cache operations are awaited.

### 4. Authentication
- **Django:** Used the Django test client with session/cookie authentication.
- **FastAPI:** Used dependency injection to provide mock or test users (e.g., via `Depends(get_current_user)`), making it easy to simulate different user roles and permissions.

### 5. Example Fix for a Permission Test
```python
# Django-style (before):
from django.test import TestCase
from django.core.cache import cache

class PermissionTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        cache.clear()
    def test_permission(self):
        response = self.client.get('/api/check-permission/?permission=can_edit_users')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertFalse(response.json()['has_permission'])

# FastAPI-style (after):
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_permission():
    # Optionally, clear or mock cache here
    response = client.get('/check-permission?permission=can_edit_users')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()['has_permission'] is False
```

### 6. General Best Practices
- Use pytest fixtures for setup/teardown and dependency overrides.
- Always clear or mock cache between tests to prevent flaky results.
- Prefer end-to-end tests that check real-world functionality, but ensure any created/modified data is cleaned up.
- Avoid test order dependencies and ensure tests are deterministic.

This approach ensures your caching logic is robust, testable, and CI/CD-friendly after migrating from Django to FastAPI.
