   Your ElevenLabs API key.
2. API Endpoint for Voice Cloning
   Endpoint:
   POST [https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/voices/add](https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/voices/add`)
   Headers:
   xi-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>
   Content-Type: multipart/form-data
   Required Parameters:
   name: Name for the new voice.

   Example curl Request
   bash
   CopyInsert
   curl -X POST '[https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/voices/add'](https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/voices/add') \
    -H 'xi-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -F 'name=MyCustomVoice' \
    -F 'files=@/path/to/voice_sample1.wav' \
    -F 'files=@/path/to/voice_sample2.wav' \
    -F 'description=Cloned from user sample'
   Example Python (requests)
   python
   CopyInsert
   import requests

url = "[https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/voices/add"](https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/voices/add")
headers = {"xi-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
files = [
("files", open("voice_sample1.wav", "rb")),
("files", open("voice_sample2.wav", "rb"))
]
data = {"name": "MyCustomVoice", "description": "Cloned from user sample"}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, files=files, data=data)
print(response.json()) 3. Response
The API will return a JSON object with the new voice_id and details about the created voice.

üîó Integration with Vapi
Once the voice is created, you can use the returned voice_id to reference your cloned voice in Vapi.
In your backend (such as in backend/app/vapi_home/api/), you can automate this process as part of your onboarding or admin flows.
üìù Best Practices
Use high-quality, clean audio samples for best cloning results.
You can upload multiple samples for a more robust voice model.
Store the returned voice_id in your database for later use in TTS or Vapi flows.
